# Instacart-Analysis-Python
This is a Python data analysis project carried out within the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program in December 2022.
## Objective
Instacart is an American grocery delivery company that operates though an app. They want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. This project covers an initial data/exploratory analysis in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.

The [data dictionary](https://gist.github.com/jeremystan/c3b39d947d9b88b3ccff3147dbcf6c6b) is also available publicly online.
## Results
The output of the project was an Excel report highlighting:
- Buying and spending patterns (day of week/hour of day)
- Top selling departments and products
- Ordering/spending habits depending on geography, age, family structure, and other customer traits
